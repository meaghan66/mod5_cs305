# SideQuests

SideQuests is a website that allows users to keep track of tasks with a todo list. Completion of these tasks will produce experience points and stickers depending on the task. The experience points will allow the user to level up, which they can compare their level and stats with friends to incentivize completion of tasks.

## Monetary Implementations

There may be a one-time-only purchase that unlocks premium options for users to enhance their experience. There will be no microtransactions or subscription models, but there may be a donations link for users so inclined to provide additional support if they wish.
